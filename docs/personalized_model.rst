Personalized signaling models

Breast cancer
-------------

Using Pasmopy, we built a mechanistic model of ErbB receptor signaling network, trained with protein quantification data obtained from cultured cell lines, and performed *in silico* simulation of the pathway activities on 377 breast cancer patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptome datasets.

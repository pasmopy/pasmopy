What is Pasmopy?
----------------

Pasmopy is a scalable toolkit to identify prognostic factors for cancers based on intracellular signaling dynamics generated from personalized kinetic models.
It is compatible with `biomass <https://github.com/biomass-dev/biomass>`_ and offers the following features:

* Construction of mechanistic models from text
* Personalization of the model using transcriptome data
* Prediction of patient outcome based on *in silico* signaling dynamics
* Sensitivity analysis for prediction of potential drug targets
